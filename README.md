# openCVmotiondetectionExample
Simple motion detection - detects objects, displays color splotches for things in motion. Should be modified for particular application - but it basically works.

Uses MOG2 (opencCV) to addaptively account for background/ static features.

Identifies objects and colors them in seperate frame. Objects may or may not be actual objects.

Inspired by David Millan's Learn OpenCV 4 by Building Projects.
